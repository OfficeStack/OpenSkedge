# FAQ
### What is OpenSkedge?
OpenSkedge is a reinvention of [Employee Scheduler](http://empscheduler.sourceforge.net), a flexible employee scheduling application designed for companies and organizations (such as education institutions with student workers) which require fluid shift scheduling.

### What is OpenSkedge not?
OpenSkedge is not a general purpose, or a one-stop everything-but-the-kitchen-sink scheduling application. It's for assigning positions to people at certain times during certain time periods that they have marked themselves available. It won't schedule your meetings (at least, not yet).

### Who is behind OpenSkedge?
[Max Fierke](http://www.maxfierke.com), an open-source developer and student at the University of Minnesota. He does [a lot of other stuff](https://github.com/maxfierke/) too. He created OpenSkedge during his winter break. He also has [a site you can go to](http://www.maxfierke.com).
